An interactive pathfinding algorithm visualizer built with React and CQRS architecture. Watch algorithms like A\*, Dijkstra, and BFS find their way through mazes in real-time.

## Features

- 🔍 Pathfinding solver algorithms
  - A\* - Fastest path with heuristic
  - Dijkstra - Guaranteed shortest path
  - BFS - Shortest path for unweighted graphs
  - DFS - Memory-efficient path finding
- 🎲 Maze generation algorithms
  - Prim's - Random weighted maze
  - Recursive Division - Room-like structures
  - DFS - Long winding passages
- ⚡ Real-time visualization with step tracking
- 🎮 Interactive grid controls (drag & draw)
- ⏯️ Animation controls with adjustable speed

## Architecture

A proof of concept demonstrating how CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) can be effectively implemented in a React frontend application. This project showcases clean architecture principles through an interactive pathfinding visualization, separating read and write operations while maintaining a clear boundary between business logic and UI concerns.

## Usage

The visualizer supports two modes of operation:

### Manual Mode

Create custom mazes and obstacles:

- Draw walls by clicking/dragging
- Place start and end points
- Design custom scenarios

### Automatic Mode

Let algorithms generate mazes:

- Choose a maze generation algorithm
- Grid auto-clears before generation
- Ensures valid path existence
